# GoogleURLscraper
Python program that can collect URLS from google.

Only a few things to change before scraping; the file to read from that has the list of queries and the name of a file to save it to.
Of course, you can change your query around for each batch.

You may want to change the wait time intervals, but I have them generously set to avoid Google kicking the program off. 

Let me know if you have questions or improvement ideas!
